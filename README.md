# Today I Learned

A collection of notes about a variety of languages and technologies that I've been learning during my work.
The intention is to build an easy and organized repository of information that can help and share.

## GIT

- [Link repository files into README.md](GIT/linksReadme.md)

## REACT.JS

- [Forward References](REACT.JS/forwardRefs.md)
- [UsecallBack with UseEffect](REACT.JS/forwardRefs.md)
